# blocklist-2-iptables
Perl Script to manage iptables rules containing IP-Adresses from various download sources (i.e. blocklist.de) 

# idea behind
a simple way to add known spammers and attackers periodically to Linux' iptables

Currently the lists of IP-addresses are coming from https://www.blocklist.de/en/index.html, it's possible to add other sources too.
The sources can be categorized (@types) so you can define your own types, these types are used for the iptables chain names too.

This scripts 
* collects the IP-Adresses from the given URLs
* creates a Class-C net if possible to reduce number of rules
* checks for duplicates
* adds and enable chains to iptables
* add rules to created chains

# Requirements
Perl 5.x<br/>
LWP::Simple

# Known issues
on some virtual servers there are limits to the maximum number of rules - ipset would be a nice solution but it's not possible to use it on OpenVZ containers
